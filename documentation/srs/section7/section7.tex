    \subsubsection{Actor Descriptions}

    
Identifying actors:\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Who will supply, use, or remove information from the system?
  \item Who will use the system?
  \item Who is interested in a certain feature or service provided by the system?
  \item Who will support and maintain the system?
  \item What are the system's external resources?
  \item What other systems will need to interact with the system under development?
\end{itemize}

Actors will be the customer/user of the application.  Most interested in our application would be those interested in Bitcoin. Service and maintenance of the system will be performed by the developers(Prestige Worldwide). Systems external resources will be blockchain, SQLite, and other external wallets providing information. (Michael and Brian please confirm external resources of Bitcoin)

      Stimulus & User initiated option\\
      Response & Additional view will open up allowing the user to manual type their wallet address, paste from the clipboard, or scan a qr code. After a valid bitcoin public address is entered the application will contact the Blockchain.info API to pull transaction information putting that information into the database. View will return to the main wallet view.\\

      Data & Public Wallet Address associated with database entries\\
      Stimulus & User initiated option\\
      Response & View will open allowing the user to change the name of the wallet.\\
      Comments & Changing the wallet address would only serve to change all the underlying transactions, therefore it may be a better idea to only allow adding or removing public wallet addresses to manipulate public wallet address data in the database. Other features not implemented by the Bitcoin blockchain, such as currency pair, wallet nickname, etc. can be modified here.\\

Identifying use cases:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item What are the goals that the actor will attempt to accomplish with the system?
\item What are the primary tasks that the actor wants the system to perform?
\item Will the actor create, store, change, remove, or read data in the system?
\item Will the actor need to inform the system about sudden external changes?
\item Does the actor need to be informed about certain occurrences, such as unavailability of a network resource, in the system?
\item Will the actor perform a system startup or shutdown?
\end{itemize}

Use cases will be outlined in diagrams provided.\\ 

The primary task of the customer/user will be to interact with the application.  Their main purpose will be to monitor their bitcoin currency from multiple wallets and tag transactions to better organize all transactions.  The actor will have the ability to add and remove wallets/add and remove tags pertaining to transactions. The actor can observe aggregate information in the form of graphs, charts, etc.  The actor will be alerted to certain trigger events. (updated wallet info, specific transactions, etc).  The actor has the ability to close and open application in running OS and also has the ability to completely remove the application from existing OS. \\
