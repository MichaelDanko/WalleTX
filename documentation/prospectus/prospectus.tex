  \section{Project Description}
  \begin{adjustwidth}{1.5em}{0pt}

  \normalsize{\textbf{Bitcoin WalleTx is a bitcoin wallet tracker tool for Android that assists users in monitoring their bitcoin balance, transaction history, and spending trends across multiple wallets. It is common for bitcoin users to possess numerous wallets, yet there do not exist many services that are capable of aggregating wallet information in order to provide the user with an overall picture of their bitcoin funds. Bitcoin WalleTx solves this problem by allowing users to group or categorize their bitcoin wallets, as well as tag their transactions with real-world information related to how their bitcoins are being spent. Charts and graphs help to identify trends in both single wallet spending and across wallet groups, a useful feature that is essential for enabling users to integrate their bitcoin finances with a more traditional budget. Bitcoin WalleTx is targeted toward all bitcoin users, as it is useful for identifying trends regardless of the number of wallets held. The project scope shall include the ability to:}}\\
